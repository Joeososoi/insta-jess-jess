# Insta Jess Jess

This repository contains a Tumblr theme inspired by Instagram.

This is my first webpage theme I built from the ground up, using HTML & CSS.
I used CSS Grid and Flexbox features - the site is responive, and looks great on mobile devices! :)

You can find all the code in the *template.html* file. That's it. All in one place.

## Usage in Tumblr

1. Log into Tumblr, and open your [dashboard](https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard).
2. From your account settings choose the tumblr page you want to apply the theme to and click customize.
3. Click the "edit template" button.
4. Click "edit HTML" and paste the content of the *template.html* file into the editor.

## Customize the Theme

You can specify custom CSS - the theme will make use of it.

If you want to make changes to the theme, feel free to use the Tumblr editor.
